# Hubbles Law

My reference material comes from zoninations analysis of the age of the universe following the same approach.  
Here is their github repository: https://github.com/zonination/galaxies

I am merely following a slightly different approach to the same project. Instead of using R, I used python.  
Instead of calculating the age of the universe, I simply look at the slope data to determine Hubble's Constant.

However I used the same data set that zonination provided, which is here:http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/leda/fullsql.html.  
Of course I used the same SQL query: SELECT objname, mod0, vgsr WHERE mod0 IS NOT NULL
